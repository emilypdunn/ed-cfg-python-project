<h2>
Sophie Germain
</h2>
<p>
Marie Sophie Germain (1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician,
physicist and philosopher. Despite initial opposition form her parents and difficulties
presented by society, gained education from books in her fathers library and from
correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre and
Gauss. She is most famous from her work on elasticity theory, she won the grand
prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. She was
also known for her work on Number Theory (eg. Sophie German prime numbers)
and her work on Fermat’s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians
exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.

Florence Nightingale
  </h2>

<p>
Florence Nightingale (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) was an English social
reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing. Florence Nightingale
exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and became a pioneer in the
visual presentation of information of information and statistical graphs such as the
pie chart, which had first been developed by William Playfair in 1801.

  <h2>
Maryam Mirzakhan
  </h2>

<p>
Maryam Mirzakhan (12 May 1977 – 14 July 2017) an Iranian mathematician and
professor of mathematics at Stanford University. Her research included Teichmüller
theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry. On 13 August
2014, Mirzakhani was honoured with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in
mathematics. Thus, she became both the first, and to date, the only woman and the
first Iranian to be honoured with the award.

  <h2>
Marie Curie
    </h2>

    <p>
Marie Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish physicist and chemist who’s
most pioneering research was in radioactivity. She won two Nobel Prizes, making her the
first woman to ever win the prize and the only person to win the prize in two difference
sciences. She is most famous for developing the theory of radioactivity and techniques
for isolating radioactive isotopes, however, she also studied maths during her time in
Paris.

<h2>
Ada Lovelace
  </h2>
      <p>
Ada Lovelace (10 December 1815 to 27th November 1852) was an English
mathematician and writer most famously known for her work on Charles
Babbage’s mechanical general-purpose computer. She was the first to recognise a
computers potential beyond pure calculation and is often recognised as one of the
first computer programmers.
